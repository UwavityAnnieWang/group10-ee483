    "You already have most of the code needed to complete this assignment from Exs 4 and 5.   \n",
    "It is recommended to combine these nodes into one node with only one callback.   \n",
    "Usually, we prefer multiple smaller nodes for modularity purposes.  \n",
    "However, this comes with the cost of sending and receiving several images which can produce lagging in embedded systems such as the Jetson Nano.   \n",
    "Therefore, we recommended to combine your nodes from Exs 4 and 5 into one node that subscribe to the image from the Duckiebot camera and outputs the resulting line segments post-line detection.   \n",
    "The MM publishes the camera image in the topic `/ee483mm<number>/camera_node/image/compressed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compressed Images\n",
    "\n",
    "As we seen in notebook 02b, you need to subscribe to the output of the MM's camera.  \n",
    "The camera published a CompressedImage, so we need to modify the conversion function in our OpenCV bridge:\n",
    "\n",
    "`self.bridge.compressed_imgmsg_to_cv2(compressed_image)`  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no need to publish compressed images.  \n",
    "**Your publishers can publish the Image message type**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing type\n",
    "Although the Jetson Nano is a relatively powerful embedded system, your image processing code will probably take a relatively long time to run on the robot.   \n",
    "The MM camera images are published about every 50 ms.\n",
    "However, your code could take a whole second to complete.   \n",
    "Left to default settings, ROS will patiently compile messages in a queue waiting for you to get to them, but this will mean your images will be seconds (or more) out of date by the time your code is ready.   \n",
    "To prevent this, we need to give two more parameters to the subscriber function: `queue_size` and `buff_size`\n",
    "Your subscriber line should look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`rospy.Subscriber(\"mm_camera_topic_name\", CompressedImage, self.flipper_cb, queue_size=1, buff_size=10000000)`\n"
