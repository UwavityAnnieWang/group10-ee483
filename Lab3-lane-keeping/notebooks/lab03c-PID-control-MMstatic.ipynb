    "## Recommendations \n",
    "\n",
    "- Your PID controller(s) may only use the P or PI components. Even if it works with fewer components it will still satisfy the requirements of this lab.\n",
    "- There will be errors in sensing as we have tested in notebook 03a.    \n",
    "\t- You may want to threshold limit the maximum/minimum errors given to your controller. \n",
    "\t- Set a maximum control signal you will send. \n",
    "\t- Calculate and remove offsets (bias)\n",
    "\t- Apply a filter to remove noise, e.g., moving average filter.  \n",
    "- Be patient and work out what your robot is telling you versus what it should be doing.  \n",
    "- It is highly recommended to use ROS parameters to control the gains in your PID code. This way you can update the gains as the vehicle runs.   \n",
    "\t- Recall about using parameters in your code in Ex3\n",
    "\t- Setting parameters by attaching a terminal `dts devel run attach -H ee483mm[number].local`\n",
    "\t- Command to set parameter in the terminal: `rosparam set [parameter_name] [value]`\n",
    "\t- Command to get parameter in the terminal: `rosparam get [parameter_name]`\n",
    "- Start testing with errors, then work with larger errors (MM almost aligned to lane versus MM perperdicular to the lane)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reminders to test code in the MM\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing code\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to Lab 2 after uploading your Docker image to MM, we need to run the following command to update any changes you make in your lab3 package. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "- There is the lab3 package in notebook 02b\n",
    "- You are running the command inside `lab-devel`\n",
    "- The laptop is connected the `robot-lan` network or wired to the MM\n",
    "- The MM is on\n"
